# Watchoo-CS50x-Final-Project

A web app used for selling and buying used watches. This is my final project for [CS50x course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/).

To run the app in your local environment, execute the following command in the root dir
```
py main.py
```

To watch for changes in React code, execute the following command in '/static' folder
```
npm run watch
```
